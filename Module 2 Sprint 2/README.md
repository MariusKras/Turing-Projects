## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews/versions/28) (licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

Apple Podcasts is both an app and a website designed for discovering, subscribing to, and listening to podcasts. The dataset used in this project is a sample of 100,000 podcasts, along with their associated reviews, totaling 2 million reviews. According to the individual who conducted the data scraping, this sample is a random representation of all podcasts.

Some podcasts have multiple category entries due to recorded changes by the creators of the podcasts over time. This duplication leads to ambiguity, making it challenging to accurately analyze and interpret the podcast market.

## Objectives

This project is made from a perspective of a potential podcast creator aiming to maximize his chances of success. Producing good content is key to this goal, and podcasts from any genre can do well. However, certain categories may offer easier paths to favorable results.

The main objective of this project is:

> **Identify the best niches to start a new podcast.**

To achieve this objective, it was further broken down into the following two sub-objectives:

1. Perform data cleaning to prepare the data.
2. Conduct data analysis to find answers to the objective.

The most important visualizations used in the analysis can also be found in a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/kpULVrONWSo).

## Main Insights

From the data analysis about the podcast market, I found:

- Reviews over time indicate that Apple Podcasts is losing a significant number of listeners and should not be used as the primary platform for distributing podcasts.
- Review changes over time reveal that the "kids-family" and "true-crime" categories are the most promising for new podcasts, while other categories are declining in popularity.
- Ratings indicate that podcasts in politics and true-crime are polarizing and, therefore, riskier.
- If it was possible to fix the issue of declining ratings for "true-crime", this may be the best category for a new podcast.
- Ratings also indicate that smaller niche podcasts receive slightly more positive appreciation, although the difference is not large.
- Individual reviews: Within each genre, listeners have a favorite podcast to which they are loyal.

> **Recommendation: Create a podcast for kids.**
